# SkinCancerClassification
Skin cancer image classification using VGG net and bottleneck features

Dataset: I used a mixture of HAM10000, MSK-2, UDA-1, UDA-2.

Directory Structure for Dataset: 
  -under /cancerImagesTraining you need to add 3 folders of images with Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Basal Cell Carcinoma, and Melanoma Images for training
  -under /cancerImagesValidation you need to add 3 folders of images with Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Basal Cell Carcinoma, and Melanoma Images for Validation


Problem Description:

Currently, between 2 and 3 million non-melanoma skin cancers and 132,000 melanoma skin cancers occur globally each year.
My main goal is to identify and classify images from each other and identify the 3 major forms of skin cancer and ultimately
perform performance metrics to assess the efficiency of my model against other existing models.

Skin cancer (SC), especially melanoma, is a growing public health burden. Experimental studies have indicated a potential diagnostic role for deep learning (DL) algorithms
in identifying SC at varying sensitivities. Previously, it was demonstrated that diagnostics by dermoscopy are improved by applying an additional sonification
(data to sound waves conversion) layer on DL algorithms. The aim of the study was to determine the impact of image quality on accuracy of diagnosis by 
sonification employing a rudimentary skin magnifier with polarized light (SMP).
